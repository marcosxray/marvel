# Marvel
A simple iOS app to access Marvel's public API. This project was a 24h code challenge.

- Your Marvel API keys should be added to MVAPIKeys.swift file.
- This project uses Cocoapods, so you are expected to run "pod install" on the XCode's project folder, before building it.
- There are a few unit tests done, but all classes are injection-ready.
